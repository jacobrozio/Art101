  <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p> The challenge of this lab was to create a function that randomizes your name.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I ran into multiple issues when trying to link the js to my html. <br> Once i finally got it to work, my output was not showing up, but my window.prompt was appearing. <br>
      I thought my function wasn't working correctly, so I tried to link another js file and test the output, which worked, but when i copied my function, it all went away.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Here are the results: the function isn't working, but the output is here.</p>
      <div>
          <h2>Script Output</h2>

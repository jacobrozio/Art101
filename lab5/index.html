	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>One of the challenges I had with this lab was that I unfortunately missed part of Tuesdays lecture,<br> so I had to try and catch up pretty quickly.</p>

	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>Again, I ran into minor issues linking the image and the javascript to the html page.<br> I get tripped up by the minute details of coding- one miss-type and it won't work. <br> Thankfully, w3schools is a great resource.</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>


	<h2>Script Output</h2>

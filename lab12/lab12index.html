      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>The challenge for this lab was to use conditionals to create a function that sorts names into Hogwarts houses.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I was pretty unfamiliar with conditionals becaused I missed the lecture last Thursday <br> that went over them, however we reviewed them
      in section and it was very helpful.<br>
    One problem I ran into was that my button was not returning the function. My partner <br>and I quickly realized it was because my button didn't have an id,<br> so
  it wasn't calling anything.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p> Here are the results! Find out which house you belong in!</p>
      <div class="input-output">

<h3>Welcome to Hogwarts</h3>
<p>Please input your name to be sorted into a house.</p>
<input type="text"  id="input">
<button type="button" id="button" >submit </button>

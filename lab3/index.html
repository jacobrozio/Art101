	<h1> Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<h2>Subject of this Lab</h2>
		<p>The goal of this Lab is to structure our files in a way that makes it easy to navigate.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>I ran into issues trying to upload an image to the Art101 page. I must have been putting it in the wrong place, because the "img" tag <br>was not turning red, and the image wasn't showing up. <br>
	I was also confused about which page needed to link the other labs and which one needed the summary of our efforts. I can get lost easily <br> since I am not familiar with coding.</p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p>Here are the screenshots for Lab 3</p>
